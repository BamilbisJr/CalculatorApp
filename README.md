# CalculatorApp

This project is designed purely to aid myself in learning how to code. The plan is to start simple with only 1 operator equations and build up new features in the app
  to learn new coding concepts. While named CalculatorApp (since the purpose of the app is to act as a replica to a simple arithmetic calculator), there are plans to
  add other features, much like other apps on a phone.
